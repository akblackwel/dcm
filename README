DCM.PL
======

INSTALL
-------
This tool can be installed on just about any system that has perl installed. It is
simply a command line interface to the modules that ONA uses to do work in 
the core. There are two files that need to be placed in your operating
system somewhere.

dcm.pl: This is the main program file. It needs to be in `/opt/ona/bin`. 
        If you choose to install it elsewhere, like `/usr/local/bin` for instance,
        you should have a symlink that points to it in `/opt/ona/bin` as
        there are several ONA related processes that expect it to be there.
        In the event you have not installed ONA in `/opt/ona`, then put
        it in `$ONABASE/bin`.

dcm.conf: This is the configuration file for dcm.pl. dcm.pl will look for 
          the configuration file in the following locations and it will
          use the first one it finds in this list:

    `'./.dcm/dcm.conf'`,
    `'./dcm.conf'`,
    `$homedir . '/.dcm/dcm.conf'`,
    `$homedir . '/dcm.conf'`,
    `$onabase . '/etc/dcm.conf'`,
    `'/opt/ona/etc/dcm.conf'`,
    `'/etc/dcm.conf'`,
    `'/etc/dcm/dcm.conf'`

          You can also specify any path using the -c commandline option.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
You will need to adjust the 'url' value in the [networking] section of the 
config file. This is the URL to the dcm.php file. This file is in the same 
directory as the main ONA index.php file would be located. So if you reach 
the ONA website by using http://myserver.example.com/ipam/ then use the same 
url but just tack on dcm.php. Some examples might be:

    url                      => https://localhost/ona/dcm.php
    url                      => http://myserver.example.com/ipam/dcm.php
